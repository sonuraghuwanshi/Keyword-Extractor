Python is a fully-functional programming language that can do anything almost any other language python can do, at comparable speeds  python python python python.
Python is capable of threading and GPU processing just like any other . Most of the data processing pythonpython python pythonmodules are actually just Python wrappers around C/C++ code.
python "Modules"  python python pythonare pre-written Python code that you "import" in your Python program. Since there are many tasks that people commonly do, we have modules that people have written that do these tasks for you, and they usually do them in the cleanest and most efficient method possible. Sometimes you will python python python python see people refer to "DRY." This stands for Don't Repeat Yourself, which often also translates into "Don't Repeat Someone Else."
python python python The phrase "wrapper" means that someone has placed, like a wrapper, Python code over another. So, when you have a Python wrapper around C++ code, what someone has done is written some Python code that interacts with the C++  This allows you to make use of various aspects of the being wrapped, in this case C++, without actually needing to know or understand that language.
