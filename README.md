# Web Crawler (Keyword-Extractor)

Problem:        Suppose you are given a paragraph and you have to find the topic or keywords of the paragraph. Then you have to read the complete paragraph and
		searching content related to that keyword is more time consuming.

Idea:		To develop an application that takes the text as input and produce the keywords, not only keywords but data from internet related to those keywords
		as well
				
Requirement:    Python3

How this works: This application takes text in the textfield and using RAKE algorithm finds the keywords. The keyword with most value is now searched over the internet
                and application provides the more data about that keyword.
                
 [  Wondering how RAKE algorithm works? ]
